# 430LProject
## Project Description
This project, called ExchangeRate, was created to calculate the exchange rate LBP/USD using transactions that are inputted by users.
It contains an interface to see the current exchange rate and to add a transaction that was made. It also contains a graph that shows the history of the exchange rate values over time.

Moreover, we can find a forum where members can post their comments on the exchange rate, but also a minigame to let users have fun.

##Project Decomposition
This project consists of 3 main directories:
1) backend is a flask project used to create the HTTP routes that the front-end will be using
2) desktop contains the front-end part of the project that runs using JAVA FX on a computer.
3) react contains the code needed to render the project on a website using react.js, whether on a computer or on a cellphone

Each of these 3 folders contains a ReadMe file that will explain exactly how to run it so you can experience the full potential of the project.
