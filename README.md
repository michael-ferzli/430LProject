# ExchangeRate
ExchangeRate is a project designed to calculate the exchange rate between the Lebanese Pound (LBP) and the United States Dollar (USD) using transactions inputted by users. The project includes an interface for viewing the current exchange rate, adding transactions, and a graph displaying the history of the exchange rate values over time. Additionally, the project includes a forum where members can post comments on the exchange rate and a mini-game to provide users with a fun experience.

## Project Structure
The ExchangeRate project is divided into three main directories:

backend: contains a Flask project that creates the HTTP routes that the front-end will use.
desktop: contains the front-end part of the project that runs on a computer using JavaFX.
react: contains the code needed to render the project on a website using React.js, whether on a computer or a mobile device.
Each directory includes a README file that explains how to run it so you can experience the full potential of the project.

Getting Started
To run the ExchangeRate project, you can clone the repository to your local machine:
 ```
git clone https://github.com/michael-ferzli/430LProject.git
```

Then, navigate to the project directory:

```

Each directory includes a README file with instructions on how to run the project.

## Technologies Used
The ExchangeRate project uses the following technologies:

Flask: a web framework used to create the backend
JavaFX: a software platform used to create the desktop frontend
React.js: a JavaScript library used to create the website frontend
